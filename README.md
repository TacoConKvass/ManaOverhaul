# Mana Overhaul

... aims to revamp the gameplay of the mage class, by changing how players acquire mana.

- No natural mana regen
- No mana stars
- All mana potions are disbaled
- New mage weapon category: Mana Generators
	a) Little damage, but they generate mana on hit while not depleting any
	b) No damage, but they generate mana in bulk
- All true melee strikes generate mana
- All true melee weapons get bigger at certian mana thresholds
	- This allows for easier mana acquisition from melee strikes

This mod aims to freshen up the gameplay of the mage class, by changing how players acquire mana.

[list]
    [*] No natural mana regen
    [*] No mana stars
    [*] All mana potions are disbaled
    [*] All melee strikes inflict enemies with Mana Drain
    [*] All true melee weapons get bigger at certian mana thresholds - this allows for easier mana acquisition from melee strikes
